# Water_heater_SCADA_system
The purpose of this system is to collect data from a client that is connected to a water heater to measure the power and water usage.

A network connection must be made to the host server from the client server. 

Edit the code "data_sftp_2.py" to specify the local file path and remote file path. 

Run 'Water_heater_data_tr.py' to perform water draw, log the data, and transfer the data to desired location.
